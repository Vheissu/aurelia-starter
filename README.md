# Aurelia Starter
Based off of the official [Aurelia Skeleton Navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation) application. If you're like me, you base your Aurelia projects off of the Skeleton Navigation app because it comes with various Gulp tasks, JSPM is configured and it allows you to start building. But all of the dependencies and files you end up removing makes for lost productivity.

This starter takes the Gulp tasks, basic configuration and offers a main.js and app.js/app.html pair. You also get some basic app structure, RESTful API support for rolling your own auth and other basics not found in the starter.
