# Aurelia Starter
Based off of the official [Aurelia Skeleton Navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation) application. If you're like me, you base your Aurelia projects off of the Skeleton Navigation app because it comes with various Gulp tasks, JSPM is configured and it allows you to start building. But all of the dependencies and files you end up removing makes for lost productivity.

This starter takes the Gulp tasks, basic configuration and offers a main.js and app.js/app.html pair. There are no dependencies like the HTTP Client or animation library here. Start from scratch and work your way up.

You might want to go further than I have. I find this is the minimum that I require, but some might not need the router or templating modules.
